# CVE-2019-9053 Exploit (Python 3)
This repository contains an exploit for the vulnerability CVE-2019-9053 found in the CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) software. The exploit has been modified to work with Python 3 and is compatible with CMSMS version 2.2.9 and below.

## Description
CVE-2019-9053 is a Time-Based Blind SQLi vulnerability which enables the attacker to enumerate the database extracting informatiaon by monitoring delays in the responses of the application. The vulnerability is present in versions of CMSMS equal to or below 2.2.9.

## Exploit Details
The provided Python script is designed to extract data from the database, then optionally crack extracted hashes using a provided wordlist and different encodings. It attempts to open the specified wordlist file using various encodings and checks if the computed MD5 hash of the encoded password matches the target password.

The code has been edited to work with Python 3 and includes support for different types of encodings. It uses the hashlib library to compute MD5 hashes and performs necessary string manipulations to handle encoding and decoding operations.

## Usage
```
Usage: exploit.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u URL, --url=URL     Base target uri (ex. http://10.10.10.100/cms)
  -w WORDLIST, --wordlist=WORDLIST
                        Wordlist for crack admin password
  -c, --crack           Crack password with wordlist
  -t TIME, --time=TIME  Time for SQLIi time based attack, default = 1
                        (second). The slower your internet is the larger this
                        number should be.
```

When you run the script it will pull down the password hash's salt, then the username, then the email, then the password hash letter by letter.
If it moves on from one of these extracted strings and the string seems short (as it it's around only 3 or 4 characters long), you should exit the program and utilise the `--time` and increase its value.
