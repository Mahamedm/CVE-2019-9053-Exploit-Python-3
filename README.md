# CVE-2019-9053 Exploit (Python 3)
This repository contains an exploit for the vulnerability CVE-2019-9053 found in the CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) software. The exploit has been modified to work with Python 3 and is compatible with CMSMS version 2.2.9 and below.

## Description
CVE-2019-9053 is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain unauthorized access to the CMSMS system. The vulnerability is present in versions of CMSMS equal to or below 2.2.9.

## Exploit Details
The provided Python script is designed to crack passwords using a wordlist and different encodings. It attempts to open the specified wordlist file using various encodings and checks if the computed MD5 hash of the encoded password matches the target password.

The code has been edited to work with Python 3 and includes support for different types of encodings. It uses the hashlib library to compute MD5 hashes and performs necessary string manipulations to handle encoding and decoding operations.

## Usage
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- Run the script to begin the password cracking process.
- The script will automatically iterate through the provided wordlist using different encodings and attempt to crack the password.
- If a match is found, the cracked password will be displayed in the output
